# Deep-Learning
What is deep learning?<br>
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers.<br>
These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain. <br>
<br>
How does deep learning work? <br>
Deep learning networks learn by discovering intricate structures in the data they experience. <br>
By building computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers, the networks can create multiple levels of abstraction to represent the data.<br>
<br>
Why is deep learning used? <br>
Deep learning makes it faster and easier to interpret large amounts of data and form them into meaningful information. <br>
It is used in multiple industries, including automatic driving and medical devices. <br>
<br>
Why Python is used for deep learning? <br>
Simplicity and Consistency <br>
Python offers readable and concise codes. <br>
Since machine learning and artificial intelligence involve complex algorithms.<br>
The simplicity of Python adds value and enables the creation of reliable systems. <br>
