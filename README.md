# Deep-Learning
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers.<br>
These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain. <br>
<br>
How does deep learning work? <br>
Deep learning networks learn by discovering intricate structures in the data they experience. <br>
By building computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers, the networks can create multiple levels of abstraction to represent the data.
